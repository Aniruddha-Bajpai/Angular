# ANGULARJS EXPRESSIONS

## TWO WAYS OF ADDING EXPRESSIONS

1. Adding expression using double braces : {{ expression }}.
2. Writting the expressions inside the directive : ng-bind = "expression".

NOTE : These expressions are similar to JavaScript expressions. They can contain literals, operators and variables. Also, to allow the expressions act like expression we need define to first define the Angular application using ng-app directive .
