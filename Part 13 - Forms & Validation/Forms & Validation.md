# Forms

Forms in angularJS provide data binding and validation to input controls

Input controls provide data binding by ng-model directive .This directive binds the input controller to the rest of the application

Input controls are the HTML input elements:

    input elements
    select elements
    button elements
    textarea elements

Note. The novalidate attribute is new in HTML5. It disables any default browser validation, but normally you will use it in AngularJS forms, to override standard HTML5 validation.
